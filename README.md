# Metal.jl

*Metal programming in Julia*

With Metal.jl it's possible to program GPUs on macOS using the Metal programming
framework. **The package is very much a work-in-progress, and currently is only
interesting to developers.**


## Requirements

-  macOS Catalina 10.15 (might also work on 10.14 but untested).
-  A discrete GPU is not necessary.
-  cmake 3.9
-  command line XCode tools
-  Julia 1.3


## Metal API wrapper

For interactions with the Metal APIs, this package depends on a [small C/ObjC
dynamic library](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/cmt) that wraps the ObjectiveC APIs
with a C interface. This library is built during the build phase of `Metal.jl`.

Julia wrappers to this small C library have been built with Clang.jl, and can be
regenerated by running `julia --project=res/ res/wrap.jl` from the project
folder.

These low-level wrappers, along with some slightly higher-level Julia wrappers,
are available in the `MTL` submodule exported by Metal.jl. All wrapped C
functions and types start with the `mt` prefix, whereas the Julia wrappers are
prefixed with `Mtl`.


## Acknowledgements

The C library started by forking [rcp/cmt](https://github.com/recp/cmt), to whom
goes the original credit. This package builds upon the experience of several
Julia contributors to `CUDA.jl` and `AMDGPU.jl`.
