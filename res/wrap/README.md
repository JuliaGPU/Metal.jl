# res/wrap/

This directory contains scripts to generate Julia wrappers for Metal and MetalPerformanceShaders.

Currently, only `enums` and `structs` are able to be generated.

The scripts are meant to be run from this directory, and at the moment, [this Clang.jl branch](https://github.com/christiangnrd/Clang.jl/tree/objectiveC) must be used.
